# V4andRecipes

A master repo for recipes/scripts transforming ONS outputs into a V4 structured CSV.


# Current Status


| Output | Dataset | Description | Filename  | Navigation|

| ASHE | Table 7 | MASTER file of 5 years worth of data. Does not included percentages. | /ASHE%20Table%207  |


# Details

All folder with the exceptions of 'SDMX to V4', 'generic V3 to V4 transforms', 'generic WDA (V0) to V4 transform' and 'TOOLS' contain V4 load files and the scripts needed to generate them.

They will also include a details.json file, example below:

```json
{
          "uses": ["pandas", "WDAtoV4"],
          "description": "Takes 1 csv file, outputs 1 V4 CSV file",
          "inputs": {
                     "1": {
                           "format": "csv",
                           "distinctiveText": "",
                           "name": "Filename"
                           },
                    },
          "transformName": "ThisTransform",
          "outputs": [
                      "Output_V4_Filename.csv"
                      ],            
          "transformType": "one-to-one"
          }
```

The idea is we can (perhaps) pull some needed details out automatically at a future date. NOTE - "uses" is intended as a quick insight into how the transformation was approached. For own installation and usage see below.

# Install

Download this repo and ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

This will include our branched (V4 enabled) version of databaker, along with all python libraries used in the wider data transformation processes.
