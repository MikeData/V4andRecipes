# Workforce Jobs - general info

Handled these are per WDA with the following exception.

I havnt broken any files down into quarters/months/years as that was for performance issues.

I've removed the "region" dimension where it appeared as we're able to insert the relevant geographic codes during the combination process.

## NOTE

WFJ JOBS03 has a large amount of sparisty, this appears to be due to the varying ages of the series.dimension within the dataset. Some date back to 1980, some were started more recently. It'll need to be sense-checked after loading.
