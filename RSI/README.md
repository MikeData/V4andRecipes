# RSI 'recipe'

RSI conistts of two individual WDA-style datasets that need transforming into V4.

Whether we gran them both together or set them up as individual pipelines...unsure at time of writing.

I've included them sepreately as the details.json is (very slightly) different but the transformation script is identical for both.


# usage

```python RSI.py <inputfile>```


## details
full details are provided in the form of the attached details.json. There's one in each sub-folder.
